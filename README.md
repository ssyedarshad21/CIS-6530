Step 1: Ensure All Parts Are in the Same Directory
Make sure that Submission_2.zip.part1, Submission_2.zip.part2, and Submission_2.zip.part3 are all in the same folder.

Step 2: Recombine the Parts Correctly
Use a tool like 7-Zip or WinRAR to properly extract the split files:

Right-click on Submission_2.zip.part1.
Select Extract Here or Extract to Submission_2.
The tool will automatically detect and combine parts 2 and 3 during extraction.
Step 3: Verify the Extracted File
Once the extraction is complete:

Check if Submission_2.zip was created.
Open Submission_2.zip to ensure it's accessible and not corrupted.
